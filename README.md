<h1>A Quick Bio</h1>
 Hi, my name is @Jinn-James. I am teaching myself to become a programmer. I have little to no prior programming experience whatsoever.
 I do know a tiny bit of HTML. Just the very basics.I have always wanted to learn programming. Thanks to the free online course at JetBrains Academy
 and Hyperskill.org I am actively learning the Kotllin programming language. I aim to learn how write android apps and other programs on topics
 I haven't quite figured out yet. I am still green as can be and I am still trying to figure out where I wanna go from here. I figured Kotlin and
 Android would be a good place to start.

<h2>My Personal Progress Report</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I started learning Kotlin @ JetBrains Academy at the beginning of March 2022.</li>
  <li>I completed my first project, Simple Chatty Bot on 4/7/22.</li>
</ul>
